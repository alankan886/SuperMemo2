A package that implemented the spaced repetition algorithm SM-2 for you to quickly calculate your next review date for whatever you are learning.

ðŸ“Œ &nbsp;**Note:** The algorithm SM-2 doesn't equal to the computer implementation SuperMemo2. In fact, the 3 earliest implementations (SuperMemo1, SuperMemo2 and SuperMemo3) all used algorithm SM-2. I didn't notice that when I first published the package on PyPI, and I can't change the package name.

<a name="motivation">

## Motivation
The goal was to have an efficient way to calculate the next review date for studying/learning. Removes the burden of remembering the algorithm, equations, and math from the users.

<a name="install-versions">

## Installation and Supported Versions

### Package Install
Install and upate the package using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):

```bash
pip install -U supermemo2
```

<a name="download">

### To Play Around with the Code
Download the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alankan886/SuperMemo2.git
```

Install dependencies to run the code:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

supermemo2 supports Python 3.8+

<a name="example">

## A Simple Example

```python
from supermemo2 import first_review, review

# first review
# using quality=4 as an example, read below for what each value from 0 to 5 represents
# review date would default to datetime.utcnow() (UTC timezone) if not provided
first_review = first_review(4, "2024-06-22")
# first_review prints { "easiness": 2.36, "interval": 1, "repetitions": 1, "review_datetime": "2024-06-23 01:06:02"))

# second review
second_review = review(4, first_review["easiness"], first_review["interval"], first_review["repetitions"], first_review["review_datetime"])
# or just unpack the first review dictionary
second_review = review(4, **first_review)
# second_review prints similar to example above.
```

<a name="features">

## Features
ðŸ“£ &nbsp;Calculates the review date of the task following the SM-2 algorithm.
<br/> ðŸ“£ &nbsp;The first_review method to calculate the review date at ease without having to know the initial values.

## What is SM-2?
ðŸŽ¥ &nbsp;If you are curious of what spaced repetition is, check this [short video](https://youtu.be/-uMMRjrzPmE?t=94) out.

ðŸ“Œ &nbsp;A longer but interactive [article](https://ncase.me/remember/) on spaced repetition learning.

ðŸ“Ž &nbsp;[The SM-2 Algorithm](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/english/ol/sm2)

### What are the "values"?
The values are the:

- Quality: The quality of recalling the answer from a scale of 0 to 5.
	- 5: perfect response.
	- 4: correct response after a hesitation.
	- 3: correct response recalled with serious difficulty.
	- 2: incorrect response; where the correct one seemed easy to recall.
	- 1: incorrect response; the correct one remembered.
	- 0: complete blackout.
- Easiness: The easiness factor, a multipler that affects the size of the interval, determine by the quality of the recall.
- Interval: The gap/space between your next review.
- Repetitions: The count of correct response (quality >= 3) you have in a row.

<a name="code">

## Code Reference
**first_review(** quality, review_datetime=None**)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function that calcualtes the next review datetime for the your first review without having to know the initial values, and returns a dictionary containing the new values.

**Parameters:**
- quality (int) - the recall quality of the review.
- review_datetime (str or datetime.datetime) - optional parameter, the datetime in ISO format up to seconds in UTC timezone of the review.

**Returns:** dictionary containing values like quality, easiness, interval, repetitions and review_datetime.

**Return Type:** Dict

**Usage:**
```python
from supermemo2 import first_review
# using default datetime.utcnow() if you just reviewed it
first_review(3)

# providing string date in Year-Month-Day format
first_review(3, "2024-06-22")

# providing date object date
from datetime import datetime
d = datetime(2024, 1, 1)
first_review(3, d)
```

**review(** quality, easiness, interval, repetitions, review_datetime=None **)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calcualtes the next review date based on previous values, and returns a dictionary containing the new values.

**Parameters:**
- quality (int) - the recall quality of the review.
- easiness (float) - the easiness determines the interval.
- interval (int) - the interval between the latest review date and the next review date.
- repetitions (int) - the count of consecutive reviews with quality larger than 2.
- review_datetime (str or datetime.datetime) - optional parameter, the datetime in ISO format up to seconds in UTC timezone of the review.

**Returns:** dictionary containing values like quality, easiness, interval, repetitions and review_datetime.

**Return Type:** Dict

**Usage:**
```python
from supermemo2 import first_review, review
# using previous values from first_review call
r = first_review(3)

# using default datetime.utcnow() if you just reviewed it
review(3, r["easiness"], r["interval"], r["repetitions"])

# providing review_datetime from previous review
review(3, r["easiness"], r["interval"], r["repetitions"], r["review_datetime"])

# providing string review_datetime
review(3, r["easiness"], r["interval"], r["repetitions"], "2024-01-01")

# providing datetime object review_datetime
from datetime import datetime
d = datetime(2024, 1, 1)
review(3, r["easiness"], r["interval"], r["repetitions"], d)
```
